== Frequently asked questions ==

= How do I get started? =

Activate the plugin and click on GroundWork from the side menu.

= How are resources organized? =

The concept of a bookshelf is used. You create books which can contain Chapters which can contain Sections.

= Where to I put the resources? =

Resource Tiles can be added to any Chapter or Section.

= What are "Resource Tiles" =

Resource should be very narrow in their focus. A "Tile" is a simple container that holds related Text, Video, or Links together in a organizational and visual way.

= Can I reuse a Tile? =

As many times as you like!

= How do I change the order of my "Bookshelf" or chapters, sections, resources? =

Simply Drag and Drop to the correct order or organization...Changes are automatically saved.

= Can I link to a particular Resource Tile to share with a user? =

Yes, just navigate to that tile and copy the URL from the browser.

= My tiles are appearing below the navigation instead of to the right? =

Your template is too narrow. GroundWork requires a full width template with no sidebars or widget areas.
