Resource Tiles can be added to any Chapter or Section.

= Can I reuse a Tile? =

As many times as you like!

= How do I change the order of my "Bookshelf" or chapters, sections, resources? =

= Can I link to a particular Resource Tile to share with a user? =

Yes, just navigate to that tile and copy the URL from the browser.

= My tiles are appearing below the navigation instead of to the right? =

Your template is too narrow. GroundWork requires a full width template with no sidebars or widget areas.
